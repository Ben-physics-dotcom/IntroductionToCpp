# IntroductionToCpp

Hi everyone,

one of my goals in 2025 is to learn C++. For that, I chose the MIT OCW course 6.096 | Undergraduate Introduction to C++,
(https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/6-096-introduction-to-c-january-iap-2011/). Here you can find the lecture nodes and exercises.

In this repository you will find my work to learn C++ based on the above course.
